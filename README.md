# Hwei's Brush

Hwei's Brush is a [NativePHP](https://nativephp.com/) app for Windows that uses the [LCU API](https://hextechdocs.dev/getting-started-with-the-lcu-api/) to let you change your League of Legends Profile background to any splash art of your choice. 

This was mostly created because I wanted to play around with NativePHP and see if I could create something using the LCU API with it. 

## Demo

## OS Support

Hwei's Brush currently only supports Windows as the current logic to get the LCU port and password will not work on MacOS. Supporting MacOS is not impossible and would only require a few minor additions, however I don't have any device with MacOS I could test this on.
